### **Description**

The Image Processor is a fully-functional Java program that allows users to manipulate and edit images in a variety of ways. The program is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) principle, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and ease of maintenance.

With the ability to load images from both conventional file formats such as bmp, jpg and png, as well as ASCII PPM files, users have flexibility in the source of their images. The program offers the ability to visualize individual R,G,B components of an image, as well as its value, intensity, or luma. Users can also flip images horizontally or vertically, and brighten or darken them to achieve the desired effect.

In addition to basic editing features, the program also supports more advanced operations, such as blurring and sharpening images, and transforming images to greyscale or sepia. These features can be specified using simple script commands, making it easy for users to automate image processing tasks.

The program also supports image mosaicking, allowing users to combine multiple images into a larger mosaic image. A graphical user interface (GUI) is provided for ease of use, with command-line options also available for more advanced users.

Overall, the Image Processor provides a comprehensive set of image processing features that are accessible to users of all levels, from beginner to advanced.
